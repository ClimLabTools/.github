## ICON

- ⚙️ [ICON Processor](https://github.com/ClimLabTools/ICONProcessor) – installable library to extract, convert and visualize ICON data (grid, model output, meteogram, ...)
- 🔧 [ICON Tools](https://github.com/ClimLabTools/ICON_Tools) - useful scripts to covert and process ICON model outputs

## COSIPY

## MATILDA

- 📦 [MATILDA Core](https://github.com/cryotools/matilda) – Tool for modeling water resources in glacierized catchments. Combines a temperature-index melt model with the conceptual catchment model HBV and a parameterized glacier area/volume re-scaling routine.
- 🎓 [MATILDA Edu](https://github.com/phiscu/matilda_edu) – The MATILDA Workflow in form of a series of Jupyter Notebooks 
- 🌐 [MATILDA-Online](https://matilda-online.github.io/jbook/) – The MATILDA Online website
- 📘 [MATILDA Online Source](https://github.com/matilda-online/jbook) – Source code for the MATILDA Online website  


## GLaMOR

## Google Earth Engine

- 🌦️ [GEE-Tools for Climate GEEography](https://github.com/ClimLabTools/gee-tools) - Collection of handy tools to process and download data earth-system modeling from Google Earth Engine
- 🌍 [Discrete Climate Scenarios](https://github.com/phiscu/discrete_climate_scenarios) – Code to download, process and, bias adjust CMIP6 climate scenario data from Google Earth Enginefor individual weather station locations
- 📡 [CHELSA-NEX Downloader](https://github.com/phiscu/chelsa-nex) – This workflow aggregates NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 data to discrete spatial polygons and applies scaled distribution mapping using CHELSA-W5E5 as a reference. It processes precipitation, temperature, and radiation for modeling applications.

## Climate

## Cryosphere

- ❄️ [HMA Snow](https://github.com/phiscu/hma_snow) – A streamlined workflow for processing daily ensemble mean SWE from the HMA-SR dataset, focused on catchment-scale analysis.

## GIS

## Misc

- 🧪 [Low Cost Sensors](https://github.com/phiscu/low_cost_sensors) – Data analysis scripts for the Bachelor course "Field Climatology with Low-Cost Sensors" at Humboldt-University Berlin
